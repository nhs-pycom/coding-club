#### 🔎 **About this session**

This session will give an introduction to interacting with APIs using Python. Application Programming Interface (APIs) allow different systems to exchange (send or recieve) data. This could be used to automatically update a record/database or to send a data extract.

Currently, APIs are mostly used in software/app development to pass data and messages smoothly.  They also allow granular access to many large databases for analytical exploration.  However, in my experience these are often databases that are well managed and accessible already so often the API work loses potency from actual application after training.   This shouldn't deter us as API usage and being a standard way of accessing data is on the rise across government and in the NHS.  In paricular, NHSX should be leading on the call for more accessible data through APIs and so understanding how to build and use these is important.  

## Example well-known APIs

APIs are all around us but often hidden away doing the legwork to make smooth data flows e.g. weather apps on your phone, paypal, and loggin through google all use APIs.
