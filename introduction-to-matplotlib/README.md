#### 🥇 **Why is data visualisation important?**

As described in [DataViz: improving data visualisation for the
public sector](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/7611/1318351.pdf):

> *Effective visualisation of data can help users explore and understand data,
and also communicate that understanding to others:*

> * *Exploring and analysing: Data visualisation can be of great use in the analysis process, enabling researchers to explore datasets to identify patterns, associations, trends and so on. Good visualisation should be seen
as a central tool in carrying out analysis.*

> * *Presenting and communicating: Good data visualisations should help others make robust decisions based on the data being presented: They should provide an effective representation of the underlying data, to help
answer a particular question at hand. Communicating data in this way
might: support senior decision-makers engaged in strategic planning,
or operations managers needing to understand where services could be
improved, or managers wanting to monitor performance*
